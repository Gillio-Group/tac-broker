For Next.js 15 projects, always use localStorage instead of cookies for authentication state. 
Check both context and localStorage for authentication status.
Never rely solely on cookies for auth in Next.js 15.quired and prohibited patterns.
3. **Automatic Application**: The rule will be applied whenever related files are referenced.
4. **Framework-Specific**: The rule targets only the auth-related files in your Next.js 15 project.

This will help ensure consistent implementation of the localStorage authentication pattern throughout your Next.js 15 project, avoiding the cookie parsing issues.
